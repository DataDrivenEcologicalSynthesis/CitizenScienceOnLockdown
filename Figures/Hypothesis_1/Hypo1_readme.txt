"AS_Observators_vs_Richness_wCitiesYear.jpg" "Plotting the species richness against the number of observators for each city and for each year."

"AS_Observations_vs_Richness_wCitiesYear.jpg" "Plotting the species richness against the number of observations for each city and for each year."

AS_LMglobal_SqrtObs_richness.jpg = Linear regression on the whole dataset, between the square root of the number of observators and the species richness. No color.

AS_LMcities_SqrtObs_richness = Linear regression for each city, between the square root of the number of observators and the species richness. Each city in a different color

AS_LMglobal_SqrtObs_richness_ColCities = Linear regression on the whole dataset, between the square root of the number of observators and the species richness. Each city in a different color.

AS_LMglobal_SqrtObs_richness_ColQuarantine = Linear regression on the whole dataset, between the square root of the number of observators and the species richness. Different color for quarantine and no quarantine.

AS_LMQuarantine_sqrtObs_richness = Linear regression on qurantine vs no quarantine, between the square root of the number of observators and the species richness. Different color for quarantine and no quarantine.

# CitizenScienceOnLockdown

## Goal of the project: 

Question
Why might we observe differences in species richness during the pandemic?

Hypotheses
1. "Bored in the house" hypothesis: more observation leads to more species detected
2. "Quiet city more birds" hypothesis: people inside leads to more bird outside, less disturbance by human acitivities contirbutes to more birds in city
3. "Bored in the house and quiet city" hypothesis: both of the above contribute to observed increase in bird records.

Scope
Taxa: birds. 
Location: Top 20 most populated cities in Canada. 
Tools: iNaturalist
Time: March-April, 2016-2020

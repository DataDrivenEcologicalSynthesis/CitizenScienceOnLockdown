# CitizenScienceOnLockdown

## Goal of the project: 

Question
Is there a difference in the number of species (richness) observed?

Scope
An initial focus on one taxa, birds. We will be looking at the two most populous cities in each province. Gives a gradient of species richness and lockdown intensity.

Hypotheses
Our conversation focused on two main hypotheses

More people are observing species

There are more common species being identified
A greater proportion of species being observed by amateurs vs experts
There is geographical clumping of observations. Possibly related to green spaces
iNat dataset would be ideal as it includes both expert and amateur observations
Quieter cities result in more species entering cities

More rare species identified
A change in the range of observed species
eBird and GBIF would be ideal as observations are verified (research grade)
